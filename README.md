# Secur-Image
#### This is a script I made during a hackathon that I wish to progress further on. It encrypts a randomly generated password and signs it then finally embeds it into an image using steganography technique
I will update this script as I learn more and continue to progress. Can't wait for what the future holds. Rn it's really wonky and prob not even usable for alot of people so yea...
